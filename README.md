# IDS-for-Fieldbuses
This is a work in progress. I have started this repository to keep a record of my Master's Thesis

I am trying to design an Intrusion Detection System for Low Bandwidth Fieldbusses. (Specifically KNX, since an already implemented KNX prototype is readily available to me. 
I have decided to go ahead with a hybrid approach, Rule based approach for monitoring normal traffic data between the terminal devices and a SVM approach higher up the hierarchy.
